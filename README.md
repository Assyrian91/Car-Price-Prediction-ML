# Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict car prices using a dataset with various car features. The main goal is to build a regression model that accurately estimates the price based on the car's characteristics.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about car specifications such as engine size, horsepower, fuel type, and more.

## Steps
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering (creating new features and log-transforming the target)
- Encoding categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Model training using Linear Regression
- Model evaluation with R² Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Visualization of actual vs predicted prices

## Results
- R² Score: 0.8720
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.1375 (on log-transformed prices)

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## How to run
1. Load the dataset and preprocess it as described in the notebook.
2. Run the notebook cells sequentially.
3. Train the model and evaluate performance.
